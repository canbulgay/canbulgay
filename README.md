### Who am I ?
  I was born in February 1996 in Bodrum. When I graduated from high school, I got into Mechatronics Engineering at Istanbul GeliÅŸim University. After studying for 2 years, I decided that Istanbul was not good for me and I didn't really want to study engineering, and I left school and returned to Bodrum, and this was the best decision I've ever made in my life. One year later, I got into the Department of Business Administration at Izmir Dokuz Eylul University. I wanted a job where I could play an active role because of my strong communication with people, so I turned to marketing and decided to develop my skills. I started working at Varuna Gezgin in my first year of school and this was the second best decision I have made in my life. I have worked with a lot of people during my time and got to know a lot of people. Every person I know has helped me reach my current maturity. I loved working as a waitress, but I decided that if I proceeded in this direction, I would not have a future that would please me, and as a result of my research, I met software in my last year of school. I have become a person who follows new developments and technologies every day, accepts software not as a job but as a philosophy of life, and wants to spend my life in front of the computer.
  
 ### My Goals
  Actually, my biggest dream has been to turn to the field of artificial intelligence since I started software. I loved math and statistics. However, I predicted that it would be difficult for me to find a job because the artificial intelligence field in the sector in Turkey is not very common compared to abroad and even if I enter this field, I do not have a sufficient level of education. That's why I turned to the web development. If I need to make a 5 year plan, I will do it as follows;
- To carry out web and mobile development processes together in the first 2 years of my career.
- Opening a youtube channel in the 3rd year of my career. (Not by producing content such as "learn software in 1 month" or "how to make money from software".) I really want to produce content that software developers need, such as English for software developers, recommendations to increase the motivation and focus of software developers, and sports activities that software developers can do to stay active.
- In the 5th year of my career, I want to take my interest in artificial intelligence beyond just being interested. I really want to take an active role in projects to help people and life.
