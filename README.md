### Hi there 👋 I am a business student on the way to become a full stack developer.
First of all, as an introduction, I talked a little about myself and my goals.If you are not interested in my personal information and goals, I suggest you do not waste your time reading.

  <br/>

### Who am I ?
  I was born in February 1996 in Bodrum. When I graduated from high school, I got into Mechatronics Engineering at Istanbul Gelişim University. After studying for 2 years, I decided that Istanbul was not good for me and I didn't really want to study engineering, and I left school and returned to Bodrum, and this was the best decision I've ever made in my life. One year later, I got into the Department of Business Administration at Izmir Dokuz Eylul University. I wanted a job where I could play an active role because of my strong communication with people, so I turned to marketing and decided to develop my skills. I started working at Varuna Gezgin in my first year of school and this was the second best decision I have made in my life. I have worked with a lot of people during my time and got to know a lot of people. Every person I know has helped me reach my current maturity. I loved working as a waiter, but I decided that if I proceeded in this direction, I would not have a future that would please me, and as a result of my research, I met software in my last year of school. I have become a person who follows new developments and technologies every day, accepts software not as a job but as a philosophy of life, and want to spend my life in front of the computer.
  
 ### My Goals
  Actually, my biggest dream has been to turn to the field of artificial intelligence since I started software. I loved math and statistics. However, I predicted that it would be difficult for me to find a job because the artificial intelligence field in the sector in Turkey is not very developed compared to abroad and even if I enter this field, I do not have a sufficient level of education. That's why I turned to web development. If I need to make a 5 year plan, I will do it as follows;
- To carry out web and mobile development processes together in the first 2 years of my career.
- Opening a youtube channel in the 3rd year of my career. (Not by producing content such as "learn software in 1 month" or "how to make money from software".) I really want to produce content that software developers need, such as English for software developers, recommendations to increase the motivation and focus of software developers.
- In the 5th year of my career, I want to take my interest in artificial intelligence beyond just being an interest. I really want to take an active role in projects to help people and life.
